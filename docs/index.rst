ACCV-Lab Documentation
======================

Welcome to ACCV-Lab!

Accelerated Computer Vision Lab (ACCV-Lab) is a systematic collection of packages with the common goal to 
facilitate end-to-end efficient training in the ADAS domain, each package offering tools & best practices for 
a specific aspect/task in this domain.

Please see :doc:`project_overview/README` for an overview of the project, including a short overview of the
contained packages and a :ref:`Quick Start <project_overview-quick-start>` section, as well as the more 
detailed guides on how to use this project (:doc:`Installation Guide <guides/INSTALLATION_GUIDE>`,
:doc:`Development Guide <guides/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE>`, ...) and further information.

Namespace Packages
------------------

Please see the documentation of each namespace package for usage instructions (also listed below).

.. The following defines the doctree header for the namespace packages section.
   You can edit it to change the caption of the namespace packages section, maxdepth etc.
   Note that the identation has to match exactly the actual doctree section
   and that the lines starting with "=====" indicate the start and end of the header as used in the 
   auto-generated code. Therefore, only make changes there which are intended to be reflected in the 
   auto-generated code.

   Also, note that the line starting with `.. TEMPLATE:` is a template for the path to the (auto-copied) 
   index.rst files of the contained packages. This is used to automatically generate the doctree for the 
   contained packages. Therefore, only make changes there if the path is changed.

   Furthermore, do not edit the lines starting with `.. AUTO-GENERATED NAMESPACE` as well as the content 
   between them. The lines themselves act as markers indicating where to write the auto-generated
   content. The content between these lines will be auto-generated from the templates in this comment and 
   the list of contained packages as defined in `namespace_packages_config.py`, and overwritten when the 
   documentation is built.
