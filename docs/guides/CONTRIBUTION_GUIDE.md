# Contribution Guide

This guide contains the guidelines for contributing to ACCV-Lab. It focuses on what should be done rather than 
how to do it, as this is covered in the other guides.

> **ℹ️ Note**: For technical details, see:
> - [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) - How to install the package
> - [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) - Package structure and build system
> - [Documentation Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md) - Documentation creation and management
> - [Formatting Guide](FORMATTING_GUIDE.md) - Code formatting


## Overview

When contributing to ACCV-Lab, your contributions should include comprehensive testing, thorough 
documentation, and examples to both showcase the achieved benefit and to provide guidance on how to use the 
contained functionality.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

Contributions with new functionality should include comprehensive unit tests that cover:

- **Core Functionality**: Test all major features and functions
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions, special cases, and error conditions
- **Failure Handling**: Verify that your code properly handles and reports errors

### Testing Approaches

Use appropriate testing strategies based on your contribution:

- **Deterministic Testing**: For algorithms and mathematical functions, test against known inputs and expected 
  outputs.
- **Randomized Testing**: Where appropriate and feasible, test against random inputs and verify expected 
  output (e.g. testing an optimized implementation using a baseline reference implementation).

### Testing Functions which Implement Gradient Propagation

When implementing differentiable building blocks (e.g. as `PyTorch` custom operators), it is important to
test not only the forward pass, but also the gradient computation. 

When testing gradient propagation functionality, it is best to ensure that the gradient which is input to the 
gradient computation to test is not simply 1.0 in each case (or for each element e.g. of a tensor). This can 
e.g. be achieved by applying another function to the output of the function to test in the forward step.

### Test Structure

Python-based tests are the main test approach and should cover the public behavior of the package whenever
practical. Setting up the tests is straightforward and can be done as follows:
- Place tests in `packages/<package_name>/tests/` directory (will be automatically discovered by the
  repository test runner)
- Use the pytest framework for testing.

For a more in-depth description of the Python-based repository test runner, see
[Repository Test Runner (`scripts/run_tests.sh`)](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#repository-test-runner-scriptsrun_testssh)
in the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).

Native C++/CUDA tests are optional supplements which can be used in SKBuild-based packages. They can be useful
to test implementation details which are not directly exposed to the Python API. For more information on
setting up native tests, see [Native Tests](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#native-tests) in the
[Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).

> **ℹ️ Note**: If you would like to include "manual" tests (i.e. tests which one can run during development but
> which are not part of the unit tests e.g. because the results need to be inspected manually), you can place
> them in a different directory (not `tests/`). This prevents them from being automatically run by the
> repository test runner.

## Documentation Requirements

### General Description

Please add documentation to your new namespace package. Provide a clear overview that explains:
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does your contribution solve?
- **Use Cases**: When and why would someone use this functionality?
- **Details of the Approach** from a user perspective: Include info e.g. on
  - Limitations (e.g. which problem sizes are supported)
  - Performance
    - Performance gain of using the optimized implementation (e.g. as part of demo description)
    - Are there cases for which the implementation is not optimal and which may see low performance?
      If so, provide guidance on when to use the implementation and for which cases it is not a good fit.

### Detailed Specifications

Document all aspects of your implementation, e.g.:

- **Input Parameters**: Types, formats, other considerations/constraints, ...
- **Output Values**: Return types, formats, and interpretation
- **Side Effects**: Any modifications to input data or (e.g. object) state
- **Constraints**: Limitations on input sizes, data types, or operating conditions

Note that this kind of documentation should typically be done as part of the API documentation by adding
docstrings and type hints to the code.

### Limitations and Constraints

Be transparent about limitations:

- **Performance Limitations**: When your implementation may not be optimal (e.g., overhead for small problems, 
  memory trade-offs)
- **Functional Limitations**: Size limits, data type restrictions, or unsupported use cases

### API Documentation

- API documentation is automatically extracted from your code
- Ensure your code includes proper docstrings and type hints
- Follow the documentation structure described in the 
  [Documentation Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

### Documentation Checks

Before submitting your contribution, please ensure that the documentation can be build successfully without 
errors. Please also check any warnings as these may indicate issues which may make the documentation 
hard to read or understand (such as broken links, missing images or code, ...), and fix the warnings where 
feasible. This helps to ensure that the documentation is of high quality, and also helps with pinpointing any
warnings introduced by future changes to the documentation.

Please also check for spelling errors (see 
the [section on spell-checking](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md#spell-checking) in the 
[Documentation Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md)).
Note that some of the reported errors may not represent actual spelling errors, but rather words picked up 
from the code, file path, specific abbreviations, etc. However, if actual spelling errors are present, they 
should be fixed. If correctly spelled words are picked up as errors, they should be added to the spelling
word list (see the [section on spell-checking](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md#spell-checking) in the 
[Documentation Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md)).

## Examples and Tutorials

Provide practical demonstrations of your contribution through one or more of the following:

### Examples

Create simple, self-contained examples that demonstrate basic usage:
- **Location**: `packages/<package_name>/examples/`
- **Scope**: Focus on single functions or simple workflows
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate basic usage patterns; potentially show the benefits of the approach

### Tutorials

Develop comprehensive tutorials that guide users through your functionality:
- **Content**: Include both code and detailed explanations
- **Progression**: Start with simple concepts and build to complex applications
- **Variety**: Include both toy examples and real-world scenarios
- **Ordering**: Suggest a logical progression through your tutorials
- **Format**: You may choose a format of your choice (e.g. Sphinx, Jupyter notebooks, ...). 

> **ℹ️ Note**: For the tutorials, the examples and demos can be "re-used". For example, using Sphinx, you can 
> write a description and insert code (snippets) and notes in a structured way.
> Please also refer to the [Documentation Setup Guide](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for further details.
> The [note-literalinclude](DOCUMENTATION_SETUP_GUIDE.md#the-note-literalinclude-directive) is especially 
> useful for this purpose, as it allows to conveniently highlight specific comment blocks, which can be used 
> as part of the tutorial.

### Demos

Create demonstrations for real-world scenarios that showcase the benefits of the contribution (for example
faster run time, less memory consumption, ...).

Note that demos for the contained packages will be added in the future.


## Code Quality Standards

### Formatting

- Follow the formatting standards outlined in the [Formatting Guide](FORMATTING_GUIDE.md)
