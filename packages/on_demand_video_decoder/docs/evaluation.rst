Decoder Throughput Benchmark (nuScenes)
----------------------------------------

This section benchmarks the standalone decoding throughput of multiple decoders across five GPU
platforms using nuScenes video clips.  All results are **6-camera aggregate FPS** (random access,
one frame drawn per iteration across all six cameras), measured on a single GPU.

HEVC GOP=30 — Cross-Decoder Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Random-access and sequential FPS (6-camera total) for the ``hevc_gop30_bf0`` configuration.
Hatched bars indicate the decoder failed on this config due to a known decord 0.6 EOF-retry bug.

On-demand Video Decoder - Across Video Configurations and Hardware

6-camera aggregate FPS for ``accvlab_gpu``.  Each pair of tables varies one encoding parameter
while the other two are held at their defaults (HEVC, GOP = 30, B-frames = 0).

StreamPETR Training Performance
---------------------------------

The on-demand video decoder was used for training a StreamPETR model on the NuScenes mini dataset and
compared to the performance to both the
`original StreamPETR implementation (with image-based training) <https://github.com/exiawsh/StreamPETR>`_,
and in one case to OpenCV-based video training. The results are shown below.

Setup
~~~~~

For the video training, the demuxer-free approach is used (see
:doc:`pytorch_integration_examples/dataloader_demuxer_free_decode` for details on this approach). Here, the
Serialized GOP bundles are extracted and stored prior to the training.

In the video training, the frames are decoded in the training process, and consequently, pre-processing is
performed in the training process on the GPU. Note that this is not a viable optimization for the image-based
training, as it adds significant overhead when passing the full-resolution images to the training process.


The training is performed for the NuScenes mini dataset, with the following configuration:

  - Video

    - GOP size of 30
    - No B-frames
    - Including both samples and sweeps (resulting in ~12 frames per second)
    - 1600x900 resolution (same as images)

  - Batch size of 16 per GPU

.. note::

  We are planning to add a demo for the On-Demand Video Decoder package in the future, including the
  implementation of the experiments performed in this evaluation.

Results & Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Results for both hardware systems are shown below.

   :width: 100%


On both systems, the performance of the video-based training is comparable to the image-based training for
the 1 GPU configuration. The video training outperforms the image training for the 8 GPU configuration,
with the speedup depending on the system. However, please note that the main goal is to reduce the storage
requirements while maintaining good performance.
