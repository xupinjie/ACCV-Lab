Resource Management Tests for Stream Decoder (CreateSampleReader)

This module tests CPU and GPU memory resource release mechanisms for:
- Synchronous decoding: DecodeN12ToRGB()
- Asynchronous decoding: DecodeN12ToRGBAsync() + DecodeN12ToRGBAsyncGetBuffer()

Key Points:
- NvDecoder uses CUDA Driver API (cuMemAlloc), NOT PyTorch allocator
- torch.cuda.memory_allocated() CANNOT detect NvDecoder memory
- We MUST use pynvml to get accurate GPU memory usage

    # TODO: Re-enable this test once a more scientific measurement methodology is in place.
    #
    # Why this test is currently disabled:
    #   The current approach evaluates GPU memory leaks by sampling the device's
    #   used-memory counter (via pynvml) before and after running the scenario, and
    #   asserting on the delta. That signal mixes together several things that are
    #   not "a leak in our decoder":
    #     1. pynvml/NVML reports device-global used memory -- it includes anything
    #        the CUDA primary context and driver retain, not just allocations owned
    #        by our decoder object.
    #     2. The CUDA primary context's lifetime is governed by driver-level
    #        reference counting (cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain/Release), so context-level
    #        memory is not guaranteed to be returned on a single destroy cycle.
    #     3. PyTorch's caching allocator does not promptly return freed blocks to
    #        the OS/driver -- see "CUDA semantics: Memory management" in the
    #        PyTorch docs; torch.cuda.empty_cache() is best-effort, not a guarantee.
    #     4. NVDEC has its own driver-level caches that can persist across
    #        create/destroy cycles in our code.
    #   The combined effect is that this test can both false-positive (driver/
    #   allocator retention is reported as a leak) and false-negative (a real leak
    #   gets masked by allocator reuse).
    #
    # A more rigorous replacement should isolate decoder-owned allocations from
    # context/driver/allocator retention -- e.g. running the scenario in a fresh
    # subprocess and comparing post-teardown memory, instrumenting the C++
    # allocator directly, or using CUDA memory tracking tooling (compute-sanitizer
    # leak-check).
