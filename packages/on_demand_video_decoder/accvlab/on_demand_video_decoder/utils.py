def drop_videos_cache(filepaths: List[str]) -> DropCacheStatus:
    """
    Evict cached pages for multiple video files from Linux paged cache.

    Uses posix_fadvise with POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED flag to advise the kernel that
    these pages are no longer needed, causing the kernel to remove them from
    the page cache. This is useful when switching video datasets during training
    to release memory cache occupied by old videos.

    This function uses fail-fast mode: it stops processing and returns immediately
    when the first error occurs.

    Args:
        filepaths: List of video file paths.

    Returns:
        DropCacheStatus enum:
        - SUCCESS: all files processed successfully
        - PLATFORM_ERROR: not Linux platform
        - FADVISE_FAILED: posix_fadvise failed (file not found, permission denied, etc.)
        - UNKNOWN_ERROR: unexpected error occurred

    Note:
        - This is an advisory operation; the kernel may ignore the request
          depending on system state.
        - This function only works on Linux systems; other platforms return PLATFORM_ERROR.
        - Processing stops at the first error (fail-fast mode).
        - File contents are not affected; only the in-memory cached copy is released.

    Warning:
        The actual cache eviction behavior is influenced by system environment factors:
        
        - System memory pressure and kernel memory management policies affect
          whether the advisory is honored.
        - On shared systems with many concurrent processes, cache state may change
          due to other processes' I/O activities.

    Example:
        >>> import accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder as nvc
        >>> from accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder.utils import DropCacheStatus
