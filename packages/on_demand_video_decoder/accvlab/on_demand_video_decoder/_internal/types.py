    """Lightweight, picklable reference to GOP data in shared memory.

    Designed to be passed through DataLoader IPC queues (tens of bytes)
    instead of the actual serialized GOP bundle (tens of KB).  The main process
    calls :meth:`SharedGopStore.get_batch` to read the referenced shm blocks
    as zero-copy numpy views.

    Attributes:
        shm_name: POSIX SharedMemory name for the data block.
        data_size: Number of bytes of the serialized GOP bundle.
        first_frame_id: First frame index covered by this GOP.
        gop_len: Number of frames in this GOP.

    Example:

        Ref to Sample: `packages/on_demand_video_decoder/samples/SampleSharedGopStore.py` — end-to-end usage of
        :class:`GopRef` with :class:`SharedGopStore` across DataLoader workers.
