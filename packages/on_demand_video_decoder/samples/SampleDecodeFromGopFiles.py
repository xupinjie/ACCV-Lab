``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - GOP Files Decoding Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient decoding from pre-stored GOP (Group of Pictures) files. This approach
enables high-performance video decoding by separating the packet extraction and
decoding phases, allowing for optimized storage and retrieval of video data.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Two-phase approach: GOP data storage and subsequent decoding
- Efficient packet data storage to binary files
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding from stored GOP files
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing
- Optimized workflow for repeated access to same video segments

    Demonstrate GOP files decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    This function showcases a two-phase approach for optimal performance:
    1. Phase 1: Extract and store GOP packet data to binary files
    2. Phase 2: Load stored GOP files and decode to video frames

    This approach is particularly beneficial for applications that need to
    repeatedly access the same video segments, as it eliminates the need
    to re-extract packet data for each decoding operation.

    This function showcases the core functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder for GOP files:
    1. Packet extraction and storage to binary files
    2. Loading stored GOP data for efficient decoding
    3. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    4. Handling decoding errors gracefully with comprehensive error reporting

    The example uses a multi-camera setup from nuScenes dataset to demonstrate
    real-world usage patterns in autonomous driving applications.
