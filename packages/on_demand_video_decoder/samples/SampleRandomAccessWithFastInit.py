``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Random Access Video Decoding Sample with FastInit

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient random access video decoding with GPU acceleration. The decoder
enables high-performance decoding of specific frames from multiple video files
simultaneously, making it ideal for applications requiring non-sequential
frame access. This sample teaches how to use FastInit to accelerate the demuxing
process.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Random frame access without sequential decoding overhead
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing
- FastInit to accelerate the demuxing process

    Demonstrate random access video decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    It is possible to randomly switch frames or select different videos with high performance.

    This function showcases the core functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder:
    1. Initializing the GOP (Group of Pictures) decoder with multi-file support
    2. Getting fast initialization information for the first clip from one clip
    3. Performing random frame access across multiple video streams with fast initialization information
    4. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    5. Handling decoding errors gracefully

    The example uses a multi-camera setup from nuScenes dataset to demonstrate
    real-world usage patterns in autonomous driving applications.
