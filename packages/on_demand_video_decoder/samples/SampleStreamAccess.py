``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Stream Access Video Decoding Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient stream access video decoding with GPU acceleration. The decoder
enables high-performance sequential decoding of frames from multiple video files
simultaneously, making it ideal for applications requiring continuous video
streaming and processing.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Sequential frame access optimized for streaming applications
- Cyclical video clip switching for continuous processing
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing
- Efficient caching for stream-based applications like StreamPETR

    Demonstrate stream access video decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    This function is optimized for sequential frame access and continuous video streaming,
    making it ideal for real-time applications and batch processing workflows.

    This function showcases the core functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder for streaming:
    1. Initializing the SampleReader with optimized caching for stream-based access
    2. Performing sequential frame access across multiple video streams
    3. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    4. Handling decoding errors gracefully with comprehensive error reporting

    The example uses a multi-camera setup from nuScenes dataset to demonstrate
    real-world usage patterns in autonomous driving and video streaming applications.
