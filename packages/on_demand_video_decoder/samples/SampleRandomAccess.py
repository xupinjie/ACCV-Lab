``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Random Access Video Decoding Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient random access video decoding with GPU acceleration. The decoder
enables high-performance decoding of specific frames from multiple video files
simultaneously, making it ideal for applications requiring non-sequential
frame access.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Random frame access without sequential decoding overhead
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing

    Demonstrate random access video decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    It is possible to randomly switch frames or select different videos with high performance.

    This function showcases the core functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder:
    1. Initializing the GOP (Group of Pictures) decoder with multi-file support
    2. Performing random frame access across multiple video streams
    3. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    4. Handling decoding errors gracefully

    The example uses a multi-camera setup from nuScenes dataset to demonstrate
    real-world usage patterns in autonomous driving applications.
