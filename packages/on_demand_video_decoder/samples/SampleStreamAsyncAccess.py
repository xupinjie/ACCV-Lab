``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Async Stream Access Video Decoding Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient async stream access video decoding with GPU acceleration. The decoder
enables high-performance asynchronous decoding with prefetching capability,
allowing frame N+1 to be decoded while processing frame N.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Asynchronous decoding with prefetching for improved throughput
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Sequential frame access optimized for streaming applications
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding
- RGB/BGR format output options
- Device memory output for further GPU processing
- Efficient caching for stream-based applications like StreamPETR

    Demonstrate async stream access video decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    This function is optimized for asynchronous frame access with prefetching capability,
    enabling higher throughput by overlapping decode and processing operations.

    This function showcases the core async functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder:
    1. Initializing the SampleReader with optimized caching for stream-based access
    2. Using DecodeN12ToRGBAsync to start asynchronous decoding
    3. Using DecodeN12ToRGBAsyncGetBuffer to retrieve decoded frames
    4. Prefetching next frame while processing current frame
    5. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    6. Handling decoding errors gracefully with comprehensive error reporting

    The example uses sample video files to demonstrate real-world usage patterns
    in autonomous driving and video streaming applications.
