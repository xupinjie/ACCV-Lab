``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Packets List Decoding Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` library for
efficient decoding from multiple packet lists with on-the-fly merging. This approach
is specifically designed for special scenarios where packet data is extracted
separately but needs to be decoded simultaneously in a unified process.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- On-the-fly packet list merging for batch processing
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding from multiple packet sources
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing
- Optimized for PyTorch DataLoader integration scenarios
- Special handling for distributed demuxing with centralized decoding

    Demonstrate packets list decoding using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated decoder.
    This function showcases a specialized approach for scenarios where packet data
    is extracted separately (e.g., by PyTorch DataLoader workers) but needs to be
    decoded simultaneously in the main process.

    This approach is particularly beneficial for distributed video processing scenarios:
    - PyTorch DataLoader workers demux batch_size clips in parallel
    - Main process receives multiple packet lists from different workers
    - Simultaneous decoding of all batch_size clips in the main process
    - Efficient on-the-fly merging without intermediate file storage

    This function showcases the core functionality of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder for packets list:
    1. Separate packet extraction for each video file (simulating worker processes)
    2. On-the-fly merging of multiple packet lists
    3. Simultaneous decoding of all packets in the main process
    4. Converting decoded frames to PyTorch tensors for ML applications
    5. Handling decoding errors gracefully with comprehensive error reporting

    The example uses a multi-camera setup from nuScenes dataset to demonstrate
    real-world usage patterns in distributed video processing applications.
