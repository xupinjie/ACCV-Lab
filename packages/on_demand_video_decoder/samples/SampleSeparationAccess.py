``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder`` - Separation Access Video Decoding Sample

This advanced sample demonstrates the Separation Access capability of ``accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder``,
which provides a two-stage approach to video processing by separating demuxing and decoding
operations. This architecture enables enhanced control, flexibility, and optimization
opportunities for complex video processing workflows.

Key Features Demonstrated:
- Multi-file concurrent decoding (up to configurable limit)
- Random frame access without sequential decoding overhead
- GPU-accelerated hardware decoding
- RGB/BGR/NV12 format output options
- Device memory output for further processing
- Two-stage video processing: demuxing separation from decoding
- Enable single demuxing and reuse its results for multiple decoding processes.

    Demonstrate separation access video decoding using dual-stage processing.

    This function showcases the advanced Separation Access capability of accvlab.on_demand_video_decoder:
    1. Stage 1: Demuxing video files to extract compressed packet data
    2. Stage 2: Decoding packets directly to RGB frames without re-demuxing
    3. Demonstrating the flexibility and control benefits of separated operations
    4. Showing practical applications in complex video processing workflows

    The two-stage approach provides enhanced control over the video processing pipeline,
    enabling optimizations and flexibility not possible with traditional integrated decoding.
